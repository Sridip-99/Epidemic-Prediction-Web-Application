						Welcome to our project on <b>Prediction by Machine Learning</b>. We are a team of four final-year students working under the guidance of <b>Professor Dr. Biswajit Sir</b> to create a predictive model aimed at understanding and anticipating epidemic growth. Using a <b>Random Forest Classifier</b> and a <b>Random Forest Regressor</b>, our model analyzes various parameters such as: <i>Location, Time, Population Density, Case Growth Rate, Death Growth Rate, Death to Case Ratio</i> to provide probability-based insights on epidemic trends. This tool is designed to help public health agencies and communities better prepare for potential outbreaks by analyzing and visualizing critical data.
